Story about olympics database.
I go through a database aboiut Olympics. In this data they provide details about what are the events in two different seasons (winter and summer), competitors from various countries. In a person table each and every individual sportsman provide unique id. Through this unique id we refer game competitor table and we can get the detail about which game the individual is participating. comparing th table game competitor table, competitor event table and medal table we get the each and every individual medal list. But to know about the sportsperson country we go through the person region table, because person table connect with region table and the region table connect with noc region table in the noc region they mention which country the person belongs too. Through the database we can get sportsperson individual medal details, country wise and city wise medal details, which country provide maximum number of sportsperson, which nation is good in which sports and etc.
